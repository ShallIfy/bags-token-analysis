Key Insight: Starting prices are $0.00001-$0.0001 (micro-cents)

================================================================================
PRICE MOVEMENT PATTERNS
================================================================================

1. ACCUMULATION PHASE (0-5 minutes)
   • Price often NEGATIVE (-6% to -45%)
   • Volume building ($50K-$150K)
   • Normal behavior - DON'T PANIC

2. BREAKOUT PHASE (5-10 minutes) ← CRITICAL
   • Price must turn positive (+100%+)
   • Volume accelerates ($200K+)
   • This determines graduation

3. MOMENTUM PHASE (10-30 minutes)
   • Price continues climbing (+200%+)
   • Volume approaches $450K
   • Graduation usually occurs here

4. POST-GRADUATION (30+ minutes)
   • WARNING: 50%+ tokens crash (-50% to -95%)
   • Take profits at graduation
   • Don't hold 100% position

================================================================================
GRADUATION PROBABILITY INDICATORS (V2)
================================================================================

VERY HIGH (80-100 Combined Score):
✓ 10-min volume >$227K AND price >+236%
✓ Sustained velocity >$13K/minute
✓ EXPLOSIVE_GROWTH pattern detected
✓ Momentum score >70
✓ ETA to graduation <30 minutes

HIGH (60-79 Combined Score):
• 10-min volume >$200K OR price >+200%
• Velocity >$10K/minute
• STEADY_CLIMB pattern
• Some positive signals
• ETA 30-60 minutes

MEDIUM (40-59 Combined Score):
• Mixed signals
• Either volume OR price meeting thresholds
• Velocity >$7K/minute
• Need more confirmation

LOW (<40 Combined Score):
• Both volume AND price below thresholds
• Weak momentum
• Unlikely to graduate soon

================================================================================
KEY INSIGHTS FROM BACKTEST
================================================================================

1. 10-MINUTE CHECKPOINT IS KING
   - Most reliable predictor
   - Must have BOTH volume >$227K AND price >+236%
   - Single most important decision point

2. EARLY DIPS ARE NORMAL
   - First 5 minutes often show price decline
   - This is accumulation, not failure
   - Focus on volume building

3. PRICE CALCULATION CLARIFIED
   - Price = % change from token's OWN starting price
   - NOT cumulative like volume
   - Example: $0.00001 → $0.00003 = +200%

4. VOLUME IS CUMULATIVE
   - Minute 1: $10K (total: $10K)
   - Minute 2: +$15K (total: $25K)
   - Minute 3: +$20K (total: $45K)

5. POST-GRADUATION REALITY
   - 61% crash within hours
   - Average drawdown: -70%
   - Graduation ≠ Long-term success

================================================================================
PRACTICAL APPLICATION
================================================================================

FOR PREDICTING GRADUATION:

Step 1: Wait for token age 5-10 minutes
Step 2: Check combined requirements:
        - Volume >$134K (5 min) or >$227K (10 min)
        - Price >+100% from start
        - Calculate combined score
Step 3: Decision matrix:
        - Score 80+: Strong graduation candidate
        - Score 60-79: Possible, monitor closely
        - Score <60: Wait or skip

FOR TRADING DECISIONS:

ENTRY:
• WAIT 5-10 minutes (never minute 1)
• Volume building + price stabilizing
• Combined score >60

HOLD:
• Through early dips (if volume growing)
• Until 10-min checkpoint
• If combined score improving

EXIT:
• Take 50% at graduation signal
• Take 25% more if momentum continues
• Keep 25% with stop-loss
• NEVER hold 100% post-graduation
